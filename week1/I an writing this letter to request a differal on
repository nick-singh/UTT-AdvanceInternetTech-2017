I an writing this letter to request a differal on my PhD in Computer Science. THe semester started (4 weeks?) ago and only on Friday the 3rd I was informed that my application was successful and that I can officially register for the semester. This was a bit untimely because my application was sent in since October last year. My current job requires me to give a two month notice before i can resign, because of this I will not be able to give my fill attention to the PhD. Because of the aformetntioned reasions I would like to differ the PhD until Semester  1 in September.
